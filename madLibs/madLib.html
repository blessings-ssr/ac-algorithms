<!-- Start with this webpage, which has several input elements and a button: -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
	<html>
	 	<head>
	  		<meta charset="utf-8" />
	  		<title>"My Mad Lib"</title>
	 	</head>
	 	
	 	<body>
			 <h1>Mad Libs</h1>
			 <ul>
			  	<li>Noun: <input type="text" id="noun">
			  	<li>Adjective: <input type="text" id="adjective">
			  	<li>A Person Name: <input type="text" id="person">
			 </ul>
			 <button id="lib-button">Lib it!</button>
			  
			 <div id="story"></div>  
			 <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.4.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
			 <script src="js/custom.js"></script>
		</body>
	</html>
	
<!-- 
1) Add a script tag to the bottom of the page for your code.
2) Add an event listener to the button so that it calls a makeMadLib function when clicked.
3)In the makeMadLib function, retrieve the current values of the form input elements, make a story from them, and output that in the story div (like "Laura really likes good code.") -->


<!-- Problem: Need to get values from the user in order to create a Mad Lib -->
<!-- We need to have two different pieces of code to handle this.
Step 1 the user enters information into form and clicks the submit button 
Step 2 we need to create an event listener to be listening on the button so that when the user clicks it, we can execute a callback function - jQuery, use .on() for a click event. -->

<!-- Bonus: Make an object with the list elements as keys and the inputs as values.  -->
